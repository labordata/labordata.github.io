# FMCS case management system
[Jeremy Singer-Vine](https://www.jsvine.com/) published a public
records request response from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service (FMCS) that provides [the schema for the service’s case
management
system](https://github.com/data-liberation-project/fmcs-work-stoppage-records).

These records show all the different tables (i.e. spreadsheets) that
the case management software uses to tracks data. For each table, the
records list the column names.

Using a schema, you can get a pretty good idea of all the information
that the FMCS tracks digitally.

I was very interested in it because it appears that the at least
employers and maybe bargaining units have unique IDs in their system.

That would mean it would be possible to get longitudinal dataset of
bargaining units from the record of F-7: Notice of Intent to Bargain
forms.

I've thought about that dataset for a while and have started on the
fuzzy matching to try to build it, but if we can get it straight from
the FMCS that would be much better.

If you know anybody that has familiarity with the FMCS's data systems,
it would be great to talk to them on background. If you have ideas, please
let me know.

# NLRB NxGen case management schema
Looking through the data exports from the [previous NLRB case
management systems](https://notes.labordata.bunkum.us/2023/02/01/39-years-of-ulp.html),
there's a lot of interesting fields that are not available for current
cases through the NLRB website (industrial classification is the one that
makes my heart ache).

I put together a public records request for the schema of the NLRB’s
NxGen case management system, and [they fulfilled it](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/schema-or-table-definitions-for-the-nxgen-case-management-system-139981/).

The case information that is available on the NLRB website is a subset
of the data in the NxGen system, and so the schema can be a useful
guide to finding information that the NLRB tracks but does not
routinely publish. Much of that unpublished data should be accessible
through a public records request.

# First Quarter of NLRB filings
The first quarter of 2023 looks a lot like the first quarter
of 2022. While the scale of organizing is still not near enough, NLRB
organizing appears to be continuing at a levels we haven't seen since the 2000s.
