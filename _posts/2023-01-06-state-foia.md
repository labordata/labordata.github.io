State and local government workers make up about [40% of the total
unionized workforce](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/union2.pdf)
in the United States, but we don't have access to current data
about organizing in these sectors.

For state and local governments, the only official data sources
for information about petitions for election, certification elections,
and representation certifications are the [over 40 state and local labor
boards](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a7XtwA8-Y-1p5kK6sFLwSoNeeQm1FAl4IGB5FZm8oRA/edit#gid=0).

Kate Bronfenbrenner has undertaken the daunting task of collection the
data about organizing activity from all these
sources. Twice. The results of her first data collection are presented
in detail in the 1995 report [*Union organizing in the public sector :
an analysis of state and local
elections*](https://www.worldcat.org/title/32430179) and the second
data collection is presented in more summary form in the 2009 article
["No Holds Barredâ€”The Intensification of Employer Opposition to
Organizing"](https://www.epi.org/publication/bp235/).

This year, I'm going to try to replicate that work using freedom of
information requests. I have some hope that the passage of twenty
years since Professor Brofenbrenner's last collection might mean we
get much of the data back in reasonable electronic format, but we will
see.

I made my [first public records request](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/illinois-168/petitions-election-results-and-certification-of-representations-138559/#) for Illinois, since it the state where I know the public records law best. I'll use Illinois's reponse to refine the request then do a larger batch of requests.

If you have any suggestions for the request, language let me know.
