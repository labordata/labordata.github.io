description: A tour throough the archives.

When my first child was born, I bought an [Olivetti Praxis
48](https://www.massmadesoul.com/olivetti-praxis-48) to restore as I
stayed up with him.

Last month, we welcomed another child into our world, and the
parternal urge has been channeled towards refurbishing archives of the
two previous NLRB case management systems: the [Case Activity Tracking
System](https://labordata.bunkum.us/cats) (CATS) that the NLRB used
from around 1999 through 2011 and the [Case Handling Information
Processing System](https://labordata.bunkum.us/chips) (CHIPS)--the
first NLRB electronic system--that was in operation from 1984 through
2000.

I've had versions of these datasets on the labor data warehouse
for a while, but I've located and added the ULP cases to the CATS
data, and converted many columns in the CHIPS data to forms that are
much easier to use.

This means that we now have [pretty detailed case-level data for unfair
labor practice cases going back to 1984](https://observablehq.com/@fgregg/nlrb-cases). I think this is the first time
that this has all been pulled together. We also have the
representation cases for the same period, which is also fantastic, but
Hank Farber has had that data for a while.

One thing that the CHIPS data helps me see is how interesting the year
2000 is. In his wonderful article, ["Union Organizing Decisions in a
Deteriorating Environment: The Composition of Representation Elections
and the Decline in Turnout"](https://www.nber.org/papers/w19908), Hank Farber
points out the turn of the millenium as a transition point in how workers vote in NLRB elctions and what types of workplaces organizers bring to the NLRB.

In [an analysis that covers some of the same
ground](https://observablehq.com/@fgregg/improving-success-of-individual-certification-petitions),
I looked at the changing success rate of NLRB election petitions, and
2000 is the year when the win rate of elections, and petitions really
starts to increase.

Farber doesn't really put forward an explanation about why 2000 was
such a pivotal year. His paper has a very nice argument about why we
could tend to see a higher NLRB win rate and fewer NLRB petitions
(basically, if it's much more costly for unions to run NLRB election
campaigns, they will tend to focus on organzing worksites where they
have a high chance of winning). But Farber doesn't identify anything
that was particularly important for making organizing harder in 2000.

I don't really know either. Maybe you have ideas.

### Help with the Unfair Labor Data
The CHIPS data comes from records on [deposit with the National
Archive](https://catalog.archives.gov/id/627716). Unfortunately, their
deposit doesn't have all the lookup tables that you would need to make sense
of the data. To figure out, say, which union is involved in a representation
certification case, we need to link a numeric ID to a table of union names.

The information we need for that is in [a big codebook](https://s3.amazonaws.com/NARAprodstorage/opastorage/live/1/8902/890201/content/arcmedia/electronic-records/rg-025/chips/113.1CL.pdf), but it needs to get
transcribed into tables. Let me know if that's something you might want to help with.


## FOIA Corner
Two interesting FOIAs came in recently:

* In April 2022, the FMCS started offering card-check services. [From
  April 2022 through November 2022](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/card-checks-april-2022-november-2022-137690/), FMCS has counted cards
  for 51 groups of workers covering at least 1,544 workers.
* I got back the [FOIA from the Illinois Labor Relations
  Board](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/illinois-168/petitions-election-results-and-certification-of-representations-138559/)
  that I discussed in [a previous
  post](https://notes.labordata.bunkum.us/2023/01/06/state-foia.html). It
  was a great response and very heartening that this approach could
  succeed.


Working with the CATS and CHIPS databases, there's a lot of data that
was recorded in those data systems that is not publicly exposed to on
the NLRB website. So, I also submitted [a FOIA for the database schema
of NLRB's current case management system NxGen](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/schema-or-table-definitions-for-the-nxgen-case-management-system-139981/).
