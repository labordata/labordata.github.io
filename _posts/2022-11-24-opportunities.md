title: Opportunities in Labor Data

description: What can we do with the data?
---

I was very fortunate to be asked by [Ellora Derenoncourt](https://sites.google.com/view/ellora-derenoncourt/home?pli=1) to share some
of work I've done with
[labordata.bunkum.us](https://labordata.bunkum.us) to labor economists
and union researchers and activists at a conference this fall.

Ellora asked me to describe the opportunities I see with the data, and
here's what I put together. My comments are limited to the public data, as
that's what I have worked the most with.

The core information systems of the agencies that collect data on the
labor movement are digital and have been for some time. We have
digital case management files for NLRB going back to 1984. Portions of
LM10 and LM20 have been digitized for a long time but the Department
of Labor finally moved to all digital a couple of years ago.

Previously, the effort of digitizing paper records was so burdensome
that it stopped most analyses before they started. Mainly, this is no
longer a problem.

Now the two main problems are

* Most of the electronic records are a mess
* Federalism

## Messy Data
With the exception of the Current Population Survey and the NLRB case
file data, most of the important federal data sources are published in
a form unsuited for analyses. The relatively good condition of the
NLRB data is a major reason why it has been so used in research, even
though the limitations of that data are well understood.

The FMCS's F-7 data should be one of the most valuable data sources on
the private-sector labor movement. These are statutorily required
notices of the intent to bargain for bargaining units covered by the
NLRA. Each notice indicates the employer, the union local, the
industry, and the size of the bargaining unit at the time of the
filing.

It's data about a stock, so a nice complement to NLRB data. It should
include units formed through card checks and voluntary
recognitions. It could inform us about the life-cycle of bargaining
units: their birth, growth, decline, and disappearance. It can tell us
about the opportunity structure for strikes.

There has been some excellent research that took advantage of FMCS
data, but it is hard to work with. Ideally, the filings, which are
effectively snapshots of a bargaining unit, would be linked over time
and standardized into a longitudinal database. That is a large effort
in data cleaning.

The tools to make that cleaning more tractable are getting
better. I've been working on a software package that uses machine
learning to standardize messy union local names against the names
tracked by the OLMS. If other folks want to help with this lift,
please let me know.

If the F-7 data were in reasonable shape, then that would
significantly enhance the OLMS data. A great problem with the OLMS
data on unions is that there is no consistent measure of
membership. There is great variety within and between unions and for
the same union across time. If the F-7 data could provide a separate
estimate of the number of local-union members currently in a
bargaining unit, that would be a great complement to the LM data.

## Federalism
So much for the private sector. The other great problem with public
records about the labor movement is federalism.

Over 80% of public sector workers are employed by state and local
governments. We have some of our best information about the conditions
of this field of organizing from [Kate Bronfenbrenner](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/people/kate-bronfenbrenner) and her
colleagues' attempts to get snapshots by gathering information on
filings and elections from every state possible. We do not have
continual access to this data however.

Here the solution is likely not technological but organizational.

Without substantial sustained funding, a single organization could not
take on that workload every year, but perhaps a consortium of
organizations could. In Chicago, we helped build the [Chicago Data
Collaborative](https://chicagodatacollaborative.org/) among
researchers and journalists that pooled collected public records to
build one of the most comprehensive collections of records related to
criminal justice in Cook County, and maybe another approach is
possible here.

In sum, using some better technology and a lot more cooperation, we
can have a much better picture of the dynamics of the labor movement
though making much better use of existing public records.
